## Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

## Overview
For this assignment, we were told to create an Employee Directory application that uses React. With that being said I created my app using Random User API, to create users for this applicaion. Also, we were told to sort the table using at least one category, an d filter the users by at least one property. 

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.


## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

Acceptance Criteria
Given a table of random users generated from the Random User API, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.
The user should be able to:


Sort the table by at least one category


Filter the users by at least one property.
